# _Why_? ü§∑

We needed a **_much_ simpler**
and **_extensively_ documented** way
to add "_**Sign-in** with **GitHub**_"
capability to our Elixir App(s). <br />

> We created this package
because everyone [@dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl)
uses GitHub so using GitHub OAuth makes sense
for our internal (and external) tools.
By making it into a well-documented and tested
reusable module other people can benefit from it.

# _What_? üí≠


An Elixir package that seamlessly handles
GitHub OAuth Authentication/Authorization
in as few steps as possible. <br />
Following best practices for security & privacy
and avoiding complexity
by having sensible defaults for all settings.


# _Who_? üë•

This module is for people building apps using Elixir/Phoenix
who want to ship the "Sign-in with GitHub" feature _faster_
and more maintainably.

It's targeted at _complete_ beginners
with no prior experience/knowledge
of auth "schemes" or "strategies". <br />
Just follow the detailed instructions
and you'll be up and running in 5 minutes.


# _How_? üíª

Add GitHub Auth to your Elixir/Phoenix project
by following these 5 simple steps:

> If you get stuck setting up your App,
checkout our working demo:
https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-github-demo <br />
> The demo is deployed on Heroku:
https://elixir-auth-github-demo.herokuapp.com/


## 1. Add the hex package to `deps` üì¶

Open your project's **`mix.exs`** file
and locate the **`deps`** (dependencies) section. <br />
Add a line for **`:elixir_auth_github`** in the **`deps`** list:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elixir_auth_github, "~> 1.6.1"}
  ]
end
```

Once you have added the line to your **`mix.exs`**,
remember to run the **`mix deps.get`** command
in your terminal
to _download_ the dependencies.


## 2. Create a GitHub App and OAuth2 Credentials üÜï

Create a GitHub Application if you don't already have one,
generate the OAuth2 Credentials for the application
and save the credentials as environment variables
accessible by your app.

> **Note**: There are a few steps
for creating a set of GitHub APIs credentials,
so if you don't already have a GitHub App,
we created the following step-by-step guide
to make it quick and _relatively_ painless:
[create-github-app-guide.md](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-github/blob/master/create-github-app-guide.md) <br />
Don't be intimidated by all the buzz-words;
it's quite straightforward.
And if you get stuck,
[ask for help!](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-github/issues)


By the end of this step
you should have these two environment variables set:

```yml
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=d6fca75c63daa014c187
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=8eeb143935d1a505692aaef856db9b4da8245f3c
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't worry, these keys aren't valid
(_they were revoked **`before`** we published this guide_). <br />
They are just here for illustration purposes.


> üí° Tip: We tend to use an
[`.env`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables#3-use-a-env-file-locally-which-you-can-gitignore)
file to manage our environment variables on our `localhost`
and then use whichever system for environment variables appropriate
for our deployment.
e.g: [Heroku](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables#environment-variables-on-heroku)
For an example `.env` file with the environment variables
required by `elixir-auth-github` see:
[`.env_sample`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-github/blob/master/.env_sample)



## 3. Create 2 New Files  ‚ûï

Create two files in order to handle the requests
to the GitHub OAuth API and display data to people using your app.

### 3.1 Create a `GithubAuthController` in your Project

In order to process and _display_ the data
returned by the GitHub OAuth2 API,
we need to create a new `controller`.

Create a new file called
`lib/app_web/controllers/github_auth_controller.ex`

Add the following code to the file:

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.GithubAuthController do
  use AppWeb, :controller

  @doc """
  `index/2` handles the callback from GitHub Auth API redirect.
  """
  def index(conn, %{"code" => code}) do
    {:ok, profile} = ElixirAuthGithub.github_auth(code)
    conn
    |> put_view(AppWeb.PageView)
    |> render(:welcome, profile: profile)
  end
end
```
This function is invoked as the _callback_
when the person has successfully authenticated with GitHub.

The code does 2 things:
+ Request the person's profile data from GitHub
based on the `code` sent by GitHub's callback request.
+ Renders a `:welcome` view displaying some profile data
to confirm that login with GitHub was successful.

> **Note**: we are placing the `welcome.html.heex` template
in the `template/page` directory to save having to create
any more directories and view files.
You are free to organize your code however you prefer. üëç

### 3.2 Create `welcome` template üìù

Create a new file with the following path:
`lib/app_web/templates/page/welcome.html.heex`

And type (_or paste_) the following code in it:
```html
<section class="phx-hero">
  <h1> Welcome <%= @profile.name %>!
  <img width="32px" src={@profile.avatar_url} />
  </h1>
  <p> You are <strong>signed in</strong>
    with your <strong>GitHub Account</strong> <br />
    <strong style="color:teal;"><%= @profile.email %></strong>
  </p>
</section>
```

Invoking `ElixirAuthGithub.github_auth(code)`
in the `GithubAuthController`
`index` function will
make an HTTP request to the GitHub Auth API
and will return `{:ok, profile}`
where the `profile`
is the following format:

```elixir
%{
  site_admin: false,
  disk_usage: 265154,
  access_token: "8eeb143935d1a505692aaef856db9b4da8245f3c",

}
```

More info: https://developer.github.com/v3/users

You can use this data however you see fit.
(_obviously treat it with respect,
  only store what you need and keep it secure_)


## 4. Add the `/auth/github/callback` to `router.ex`

Open your `lib/app_web/router.ex` file
and locate the section that looks like `scope "/", AppWeb do`

Add the following line:

```elixir
get "/auth/github/callback", GithubAuthController, :index
```

That will direct the API request response
to the `GithubAuthController` `:index` function we defined above.

> Example:
[/lib/app_web/router.ex#L20](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-github-demo/blob/8dd8f7dd7cc43a9a7e918dd11c920833e17ef0af/lib/app_web/router.ex#L20)


## 5. Update `PageController.index`

In order to display the "Sign-in with GitHub" button in the UI,
we need to _generate_ the URL for the button in the relevant controller,
and pass it to the template.

Open the `lib/app_web/controllers/page_controller.ex` file
and update the `index` function:

From:
```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  render(conn, "index.html")
end
```

To:
```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  oauth_github_url = ElixirAuthGithub.login_url(%{scopes: ["user:email"]})
  render(conn, "index.html", [oauth_github_url: oauth_github_url])
end
```

Example:
[`lib/app_web/controllers/page_controller.ex#L4-L7`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-github-demo/blob/5e564729ec839379697761d9b72cddf413f8eb0e/lib/app_web/controllers/page_controller.ex#L4-L7)


### 5.1 Update the `page/index.html.eex` Template

Open the `/lib/app_web/templates/page/index.html.eex` file
and type (_or paste_) the following code:

```html
<section class="phx-hero">
  <h1>Welcome to Awesome App!</h1>
  <p>To get started, login to your GitHub Account: </p>
  <a href={@oauth_github_url} >
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qwoHBIZ.png" alt="Sign in with GitHub" />
  </a>
</section>
```

> **Note**: we are using an `<img>` button for code brevity. <br />
We suggest you use the `SVG+CSS` approach described
[below](#optimised-svgcss-button). üëá

## 6. _Run_ the App!

Run the app with the command:

```sh
mix phx.server
```

Visit the  home page of the app
where you will see a
"Sign in with GitHub" button:
http://localhost:4000

![sign-in-button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/73599088-91366380-4537-11ea-84aa-b473da4ca379.png)

Once the user authorizes the App,
they will be redirected
back to the Phoenix App
and will see welcome message:

![welcome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/73599112-e8d4cf00-4537-11ea-8379-a58affbea560.png)


## _Congratulations_! You have GitHub Oauth in your Elixir App! üéâ

<br />


## _Testing_

@dwyl we feel that testing is 1/3 of the "deliverable"
(_with the other two thirds being docs and business logic_)
so we pay close attention to "testability".

With that in mind we have exported a _transparent_
["TestDouble"](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html)
which intercepts HTTP requests when the `MIX_ENV` is `"test"`.

To see the responses returned by the TestDouble,
see:
[`lib/httpoison_mock.ex`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-github/blob/master/lib/httpoison_mock.ex)

And to see how the tests assert these responses,
see:
[`test/elixir_auth_github_test.exs`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-github/blob/master/test/elixir_auth_github_test.exs)


To use the tests add the following config to your `test.exs` file:

```
config :elixir_auth_github,
  client_id: "d6fca75c63daa014c187",
  client_secret: "8eeb143935d1a505692aaef856db9b4da8245f3c",
  httpoison_mock: true
```

<br /> <br />


## _Optimised_ SVG+CSS Button

In **step 5.1** above, we suggest using an `<img>`
for the `Sign in with GitHub` button.

But even though this image appears small **`357‚Ää√ó‚Ää61 px`**
https://i.imgur.com/qwoHBIZ.png it is **`9kb`**:

![sign-in-with-github-button-9kb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/73606149-1143e400-459f-11ea-941f-ae62d3918778.png)

We could spend some time in a graphics editor optimising the image,
but we _know_ we can do better by using our `CSS` skills! üí°

The following code re-creates the `<img>`
using the GitHub logo **`SVG`**
and `CSS` for layout/style:

```html
<div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; width:180px; margin-left:20px">
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto&display=swap">
  <a href="<%= @oauth_github_url %>"
    style="display:inline-flex; align-items:center; min-height:30px;
      background-color:#24292e; font-family:'Roboto',sans-serif;
      font-size:14px; color:white; text-decoration:none;">
    <div style="margin: 1px; padding-top:5px; min-height:30px;">
    <svg height="18" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="32px" style="fill:white;">
      <path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M8 0C3.58 0 0 3.58 0 8c0 3.54 2.29 6.53 5.47 7.59.4.07.55-.17.55-.38
      0-.19-.01-.82-.01-1.49-2.01.37-2.53-.49-2.69-.94-.09-.23-.48-.94-.82-1.13-.28-.15-.68-.52-.01-.53.63-.01
      1.08.58 1.23.82.72 1.21 1.87.87
      2.33.66.07-.52.28-.87.51-1.07-1.78-.2-3.64-.89-3.64-3.95 0-.87.31-1.59.82-2.15-.08-.2-.36-1.02.08-2.12
      0 0 .67-.21 2.2.82.64-.18 1.32-.27 2-.27.68 0 1.36.09 2 .27 1.53-1.04 2.2-.82 2.2-.82.44 1.1.16 1.92.08
      2.12.51.56.82 1.27.82 2.15 0 3.07-1.87 3.75-3.65 3.95.29.25.54.73.54 1.48 0 1.07-.01 1.93-.01 2.2 0
      .21.15.46.55.38A8.013 8.013 0 0016 8c0-4.42-3.58-8-8-8z"/>
    </svg>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 5px;">
      Sign in with GitHub
    </div>
  </a>
<div>
```

The result looks _better_ than the `<img>` button:

![img-vs-svg-button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/73606464-71885500-45a2-11ea-995c-9abdd4c6b983.png)

It can be scaled to any screen size so it will _always_ look great! <br />
Using http://bytesizematters.com we see that our SVG+CSS button is only **`1kb`**:
![byte-size-of-github-button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/71247098-fcbdcc00-230f-11ea-883d-8ed4d428846b.png)

That is an **87.5%** bandwidth saving
on the **`9kb`** of the
[**`.png`** button](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google/issues/25).
And what's _more_ it reduces the number of HTTP requests
which means the page loads _even_ faster.

This is used in the Demo app:
[`lib/app_web/templates/page/index.html.eex`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-github-demo/blob/bdabb5e16ee8f49adf9e18ca3bb313e7f81b33ba/lib/app_web/templates/page/index.html.eex)


### `i18n`

The _biggest_ advantage of having an SVG+CSS button
is that you can _translate_ the button text! <br />
Since the text/copy of the button is now _just_ text in standard HTML,
the user's web browser can _automatically_ translate it! <br />
e.g: _French_ üá¨üáß > üá´üá∑

![french-transalation-of-interface](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/73606612-e8721d80-45a3-11ea-98dd-2ef2e7eee0e3.png)

This is _much_ better UX for the **80%** of people in the world
who do _not_ speak English _fluently_.
The _single_ biggest engine for growth in startup companies
is [_translating_](https://youtu.be/T9ikpoF2GH0?t=463)
their user interface into more languages.
Obviously don't focus on translations
while you're building your MVP,
but if it's no extra _work_
to use this SVG+CSS button
and it means the person's web browser
can _automatically_ localise your App!

### _Accessibility_

The `SVG+CSS` button is more accessible than the image.
Even thought the `<img>` had an `alt` attribute
which is a lot better than nothing,
the `SVG+CSS` button can be re-interpreted
by a non-screen device and more easily transformed.
